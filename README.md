I want to learn Go, Web Sockets, implementing JSON web tokens, implementing session auth from scratch, and eventually oath.

I also want to improve at writing pure CSS and HTML.

The main objective of this is to create an application utilizing primitive web technologies i.e. no react or heavy django abstractions.

GoChat will be a client server messaging platform aimed at bolstering these skills.


Roadmap


1.) Session authentication and simple login interface.
