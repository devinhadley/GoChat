I want to learn Go, Web Sockets, implementing JSON web tokens, implementing session auth from scratch, and eventually oath.

I also want to improve at writing pure CSS and HTML.

GoChat will be a client server messaging platform aimed at bolstering these skills.


Roadmap


1.) Session authentication and simple login interface.
