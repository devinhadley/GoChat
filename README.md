I want to learn Go, Web Sockets, implementing JSON web tokens, implementing session auth from scratch, and eventually oath.

I also want to improve at writing pure CSS and HTML.

GoChat will be a simple peer to peer messaging platform aimed at bolstering these skills.

As a first iteration

Users will signup, add eachother, and then engage in private messaging.
