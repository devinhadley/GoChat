**I want to learn:**
- Go
- Web Sockets
- Implementing session auth from "scratch".
- Social auth from "scratch".

**I want to improve at:**

- Writing pure html, css, and javascript.

GoChat will be client server messaging platform aimed at bolstering these skills.

It will use server side rendering for the UI and UI flow with sockets/messaging being the only use of JS.

I will develop the entire platform using VIM with no plugins to bolster learning.

**Roadmap**

1.) Session authentication and simple login interface.

2.) Chat interface (one global room).
